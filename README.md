# datdota-ui-rework
Sandbox for fiddling with elements of styling and UI 

Elements
---------

* Default layout: sidebar, header, footer, main
* Main layouts: unabridged or v-split (i.e. query/result)
* Query elements: filters, buttons
* Result elements: datatables, graphs
* Generic elements: team / hero logos, team links, player links

Don't try edit any vendor files.

A bunch of static images in the mock_stuff folder to tinker with.

./dev.bat uses Python 3's http.server to serve the files, but use whatever you'd like.
